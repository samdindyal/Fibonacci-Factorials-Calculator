#Fibonacci/Factorials Calculator

A small application I wrote for a French presentation, in Java, I did on recursion. It calculates numbers in the fibonacci sequence and factorials recursively and displays them on a small, clean and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

This application can be run from the "interfaceUtilsateur" class.
